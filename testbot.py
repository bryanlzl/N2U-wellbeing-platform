# This class, which employs the telegram.ext.Dispatcher, provides a frontend to telegram.Bot to the programmer, so they can focus on coding the bot.
# Its purpose is to receive the updates from Telegram and to deliver them to said dispatcher.
# It also runs in a separate thread, so the user can interact with the bot, for example on the command line.
# The dispatcher supports handlers for different kinds of data: Updates from Telegram, basic text commands and even arbitrary types.
# The updater can be started as a polling service or, for production, use a webhook to receive updates. This is achieved using the WebhookServer and WebhookHandler classes.

# Logging purposes and debugging in case of serious or fatal errors.
